# ü•∑ Rogue Service (Python)

**Rogue Service** is a FastAPI-based microservice that represents a rogue-type bot in the "Battle of the Bots" tournament system. It integrates into a Spring Cloud ecosystem using Spring Cloud Sidecar and retrieves its battle configuration dynamically from a Spring Cloud Config Server.

---

## üì¶ Features

- REST endpoint to **spawn a rogue bot instance** with randomized name and config-defined stats.
- `/health.json` endpoint for Spring Cloud Sidecar compatibility.
- Dynamically loads configuration from a Spring Cloud Config Server (Git-backed).
- Designed to be **polyglot-compatible** with Spring Boot via Eureka + Feign.
